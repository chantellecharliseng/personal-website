# personal-website

i've always wanted to make a personal website and use my design skills to create a BEAUTIFUL user interface

here we are!

i'm thinking of looking at this project as more of a "life" website to express my interests in art and culture than a "work/academic" website 

i think i'll still include a password protected section for employers though
there, i'll showcase my obsession with biomechanics and include a bit more personal information like my resume
